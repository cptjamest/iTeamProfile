										<h1>Music</h1>
									</header>
									<p>Music has been a passion for me since the first time I listened to rap. I was in the sixth grade, one of the students asked to play rap god by Eminem on the smart board (the clean version of course). I remember hearing the way the words tied together in the most genius way. Every syllable connected throughout multiple words, every word beautifully pieced together. Most people don’t find rap beautiful, but I find the harmony of the rhymes better than what any singer could provide.</p>
									<p>I started producing beats when I was 15. I wasn’t very good, but I started to see the pieces of the puzzle coming together as I made each one. I identified what was wrong and what I needed to do better the next time. By my 20th beat I was half decent, but I still had a long way to go. The first beat that I produced that made me emotional, was called memories in the moonlight. I remember using my heart rate as the bpm and playing a piano melody that was nothing short of perfect. I remember thinking about my mum while I was creating it, thinking about the amazing memories I’d had with her when I was a young child. The first time I listened to the completed version, I had tears slowly rolling down my face as my grin stayed. Although the beat may be gone forever, the effect it had on me won’t go away anytime soon.</p>
									<p>The beat that I have attached below, is called mesmerised. I created it at a time in my life where everything seemed to be moving so fast, that all I could do was watch it fly by, mesmerised.</p>
