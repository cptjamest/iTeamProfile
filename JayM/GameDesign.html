										<h1>Game Design</h1>
									</header>
									<p>I first started creating games when I was 11, my first projects were created using scratch. I stopped creating games when I was 12, and only picked it back up when I was 17. I started researching about Unreal Engine and became intrigued by the beautiful level design. I decided to create my own game. Unfortunately, I bit off more than I could chew, I attempted to make a AAA level game on my first attempt. The idea had excellent potential but, without the skills to execute what I dreamt of it wasn’t possible. Early pictures of the game are below.</p>
									<p>I decided that I would have to gain many skills before pursuing such a game, so, I enrolled in an undergraduate certificate in Game Design and Animation. The course was fantastic, I gained many applicable skills but, I still didn’t have enough skill to create the game I dreamt of. Every time I tried to come up with a small project idea, it just got bigger and bigger. The lesson I’ve taken from this experience is that it’s great to shoot for the moon, but if you leave the atmosphere, that’s great too.</p>
									<p>I’m excited for the group project because it will help me create projects at a smaller scale and, give me practise at working with a team. I believe the group project will help me minimise my Icarus tendencies when it comes to developing games.</p>
