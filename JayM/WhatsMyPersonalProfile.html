									<p>The Myers Briggs Personality Type test indicates that my strengths are logical thinking, intuition and determination. My weaknesses are arrogance, over criticism and dismission of emotions. The Myers Briggs Personality Type test also has ‘roles’ that they assign to people, in my case I received the ‘analyst role’. 16personalities.com states that people who possess the analyst role are thinkers, driven by curiosity. They also claim that people with the analyst role are independent minds, and lone wolves. The Myers Briggs Personality Type Test has a set of ‘strategies’ that they assign to people as well. My strategy is the ‘constant improvement strategy’. 16personalities.com claims that people who have this strategy type are sensitive souls, driven by doubt and, they constantly change their minds about their career path.</p>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/LearningStyleTest.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>The online learning style test (learningstylesonline.com) indicates that I learn based on logic primarily and learn well in group environments or in solitude. The test also indicates that I am an aural learner and a verbal learner. The test states that my learning weaknesses are physical learning and sub-par visual learning.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/IdealistWorkStyleQuiz.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>The workstyle test (idealist.org) indicates that my strengths are organising and planning a clear path, managing projects and developing communication strategies. The test states that I should keep in mind that it’s important that I find the time to effectively contribute to the project alongside my co-workers (or group members), as opposed to administrating constantly.</p>
									<p>I believe that these tests are accurate, some aren’t on the dot, but accurate, nonetheless. The Myers Briggs test has the most validity out of all of these. I believe that this is primarily because the test is a modified version of Carl G. Jung’s test, one of the greatest minds to ever grace the field of psychology. The traits were mostly accurate, even if I don’t want to admit some. The trait that is unlike me is the lone wolf trait, this trait is partially true because I work well alone but, it’s false because I work well in teams as well. I believe this test may describe my traits better than many people I know. The online learning test was mostly accurate, but I believe that the online learning test got some traits wrong. For example, I would describe myself as more of a visual learner, less of an aural learner and, more of a practical learner than the test claims. I believe that this test has good validity but lacks the execution. This test doesn’t seem to represent my learning style as well as the Myers Briggs Personality test showcased my personality. The workstyle test was accurate, it described most of my workstyle to a tee. I feel like the only place it falls short is where it claims that I should share my ideas more. When working in groups I am often sharing ideas and love to do so. This test was nearly perfect but, that one detail is wrong.</p>
									<p>In conclusion, the personality tests indicate that I will be a great teammate when it comes to logical problems, developing strategies and analysing situations but, my weaknesses as a teammate will likely be, doubtfulness, too much administration, and changing my mind on the direction of the project. The tests also indicate that I would be best to team up with people who are group oriented and optimistic. The best thing for me to do when finding a group, is to find people whose strengths are my weaknesses. If our strengths are each other’s weaknesses, we have no weaknesses.</p>
